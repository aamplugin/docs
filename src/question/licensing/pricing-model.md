The premium "Complete Package" adopts unorthodox for WordPress "pay-as-you-go" pricing model. First of all, this is a yearly subscription plan and we offer two options - _Basic_ & _Developer_. The _Basic_ plan allows you to install AAM only on one website, while _Developer_ plan - on three. The only difference is the initial price that you pay - $99 for the _Basic_ and $149 for the _Developer_. The second option gives you ~25% in savings.

Both plans adhere to the pay-as-you-go model. However, if you need to extend the limit, then move forward and install the downloaded plugin on as many websites as needed. Our system will automatically detect new domain and adjust your pricing plan accordingly. For every new domain we will charge additional $39/year.

The renewal cost is adjusted both ways. With the same notion, if you reduce the number of active domains, the yearly amount will reduce accordingly.

::: tip Note!
If you accidentally install the premium plugin on a new website, or you need to run some tests first, you have up to seven days to uninstall the plugin and  deactivate the domain on the [license page](/license). This way, we will not charge you for the extra domain.

If you know up-front that you will be using the premium plugin on more than three websites, then you can increase the number of domains during the checkout process with **Additional Domains** field.
