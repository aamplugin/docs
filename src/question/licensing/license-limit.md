title: How does the license limit work?
---

::: question Question
On my license page, I see the _up to 3 domains before additional charges may apply_ statement. What is the license limit, and how does it work?
:::

The license limit is the number of domains you can have the premium [Complete Package](/premium) installed before purchasing additional "credits".

::: info Note!
The license limit **does not** contribute to the final cost of the yearly renewal. The renewal cost is calculated based on the license type and the number of active domains.

Let's say, Emily purchased a Regular license key for $149. It allows her to download and use the Complete Package on up to 3 domains. She activated the premium add-on on three websites successfully. At this point, her year subscription amount stays at $149.

Her project expands, and she needs the premium add-on on one more websites. So she downloads and installs the Complete Package on the fourth domain. Because Emily's license limit is up to 3 domains, our system notifies her via email about the upcoming charges for the additional domain.

It all may sound unconventional. However, if you do the math, you notice that after obtaining a license key, you can purchase additional copies of the premium Complete Package only for $39/year.
