title: How to allow WordPress users editing only their own page?
---

::: question Question
I have a group of users that should have access to the WordPress backend to be able to edit only one page each. For example, Andy can edit only the "Andy's Page" and Emmy - only the "Emmy's Page". How can I do this with AAM?
