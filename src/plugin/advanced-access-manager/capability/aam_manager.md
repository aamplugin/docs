By default, only users with the _Administrator_ role have access to the AAM services, however, you can change this behavior by adding the custom `aam_manager` capability.

This is the first-tier access capability to AAM functionality. You still need to assign additional custom capabilities to grant access to very specific features. For example [aam_manage_admin_menu](/plugin/advanced-access-manager/capability/aam_manage_admin_menu) for the "Backend Menu" feature or [aam_manage_content](/plugin/advanced-access-manager/capability/aam_manage_content) for the "Posts & Terms" feature.

::: info FYI!
