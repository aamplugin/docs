There are several reasons you may want to leverage AAM RESTful API endpoints to manage JWT tokens for your users. One of the most common is a centralized user management system shared across multiple WordPress instances. With this setup, you may want to manage JWT tokens for any user from that system. In this case, cross-application integration is required, and AAM gives you all the necessary "pipes".

All the RESTful API endpoints for the JWT Token service are well documented in the [RESTful API Reference](/advanced/restful/reference/jwt) section. Though, it is beneficial to go over each endpoint again and explain them in greater detail.
